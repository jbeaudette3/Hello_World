# Hello_World
Testing automating upload schedule to write "Hello World" in contribution chart.  
My hope is I don't get banned or anything like that. Just trying to learn.

2025.04.01 update/ documentation:
- created 'main' file as a simple housing of the python code, it's not formatted 'properly' but it works in a jupyter notebook


ToDo:
- Create YAML file to run via GitHub Actions
