# Hello_World
Testing automating upload schedule to write "Hello World" in contribution chart.  
My hope is I don't get banned or anything like that. Just trying to learn.

2025.04.26:
 - added requirements.txt
 - created test_1.py
 - got weather_data_dict.json to update as expected

Next:
 - turn action from on request to crontab (2x a day with 12 hour delay?)
 - read list of pattern, pop from list, update
