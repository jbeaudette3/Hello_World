# Hello_World
Testing automating upload schedule to write "Hello World" in contribution chart.  
My hope is I don't get banned or anything like that. Just trying to learn.

2025.04.27:
 - adding on schedule works. Does create (if not exists)?

2025.04.26:
 - added requirements.txt
 - created test_1.py
 - got weather_data_dict.json to update as expected

Next:
 - read list of pattern, pop from list, update
 - pattern may be better if it's the date (if today's date is in list of allowable dates, run, then pop from list)
 - allows for multiple runs in a day
